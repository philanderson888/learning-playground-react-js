# Google Calendar API

In here are plain HTML files with some Javascript and they interrogate the Google Calendar API and read data in various formats.  Use `index.html` to load up the site and get everything working.

In `data.js` are 3 keys - `API_KEY`, `CLIENT_ID` and also a single `CalendarId` which can be any calendar id
