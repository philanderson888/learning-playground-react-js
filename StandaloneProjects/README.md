## [mern-stack-shopping-list](mern-stack-shopping-list-05)

This is a series of apps built from Traversy Media and his, Brad Traversy, amazing walkthroughs on teaching coding in a very simple fashion, line by line, which I like.

This app builds a back end MongoDB, a back end API to expose the DB, database containing shopping items and users, creation of tokens on user registration, validation of token on user login.  Also it creates a React front end application which lists shopping items and has a user registration, login and logout page.  Shopping items can be listed without authentication but not added nor removed unless authentication has taken place.
