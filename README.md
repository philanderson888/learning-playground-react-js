# React

This is a teaching repository for React created by Facebook.

The repo is sorted into [single file react projects](SingleHtmlFiles) which can be run as standalone files ie they have React imported as a CDN into a single HTML file.  

Also I have a much more complex set of standalone projects built with the `create-react-app` [here](StandaloneProjects).

Happy learning!
