# MobX_01

This is my first ever attempt to look at a new technology, MobX which is an update from React with Typescript.

I am following along with EggHead and also on GitHub from [https://github.com/basarat/mobx-typescript-react/tree/master/01%20init](https://github.com/basarat/mobx-typescript-react/tree/master/01%20init)

so the first thing is to copy down the files for the first project, 01 init

Next yarn is not installed so install it with 

```bash
brew install yarn
```

so let's now try the command to install all the files

```bash
yarn install
```
